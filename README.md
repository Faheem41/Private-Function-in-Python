<h2>Why use the code?</h2>
Let's start with the concept of private functions. Private functions are functions that are only accessible inside the declared module, no other function from any other module can access it.</br>
This project mainly focuses on the security issues of a code. This enables a way to restrict code from accessing other functions from other modules that were not meant to be accessed. And thus, it ensures that only non-private functions i.e. public functions can be accessed from anywhere outside the code.</br></br>
Here's an example, suppose a module has two functions: add() and main(). main() function is meant to run and can be called from other modules. On the other hand, the add() function is a function that is only called by the main() function, and we want to keep this function private, i.e. ensure that it cannot be accessed or called from any other module.

<h2>Understanding the code</h2>
Have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/Faheem41/Private-Function-in-Python/blob/main/src/main.py" rel="noreferrer">private.py</a> file; the documentation of the code, along with how the code is working is given inside the source code.
